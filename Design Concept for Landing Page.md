# Design Concept for Landing Page

## Inspiration: Ento.ma Analysis

Ento.ma utilizes a modern, clean, and professional aesthetic. Key observations:

*   **Color Palette:** Predominantly dark background (navy/dark blue) with bright, contrasting text (white/light gray) and a vibrant accent color (blue/purple gradient). The overall feel is sophisticated and tech-oriented.
*   **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts are used throughout, appearing clean and highly legible. Headings are large and impactful, while body text is well-spaced for readability.
*   **Layout:** Sections are clearly defined with ample white space (or dark space in this case) to prevent clutter. The hero section is full-screen with a central call to action. Content blocks are visually distinct and often use icons.
*   **Animations/Interactivity:** Subtle hover effects on buttons and links, possibly some smooth transitions or fades on scroll, contributing to a premium feel without being distracting.
*   **Imagery:** Abstract, tech-related graphics or subtle background patterns are used, rather than prominent photographic images.

## Proposed Design for New Landing Page

Based on the user's request and the Ento.ma analysis, the new landing page will adhere to the following design principles:

*   **Overall Aesthetic:** Modern, minimalist, and high-end. Emphasis on elegance and simplicity.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** White, Black, Light Gray (for backgrounds, text, and subtle elements).
    *   **Accent Color:** A modern, subtle accent color (e.g., a muted teal, soft gold, or a very light, desaturated blue) to be used sparingly for CTAs, highlights, and icons. This will provide a touch of sophistication without overwhelming the minimalist feel.
*   **Typography:** Elegant and legible sans-serif fonts. Headings will be prominent but clean, and body text will be clear and easy to read.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Navigation:** Logo on the left, navigation links (Accueil, À propos, Contact) on the right.
    *   **Hero Section:** Full-screen, centrally aligned title, subtitle, and CTA button. Minimal text to maintain impact.
    *   **Content Sections:** Clean, well-spaced blocks for 

Présentation rapide, Secteurs et clients cibles, Valeurs clés, and Footer.
*   **Secteurs et clients cibles:** Visual blocks or cards with icons and short descriptions. The icons should be simple and line-based to maintain the minimalist aesthetic.
*   **Valeurs clés:** Four distinct blocks, each with an icon and a single word. Icons should be abstract or symbolic representations of the values.
*   **Footer:** Simple and clean, containing a contact form (Name, Email, Message), contact details (email, phone), social media icons, and copyright information. The form should blend seamlessly with the minimalist design.

*   **Responsiveness:** The design will be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop and mobile views. This will involve flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries for breakpoints.
*   **Animations/Interactivity:** Subtle and fluid animations for hover states on buttons and links, and potentially subtle fade-in or slide-up effects for sections as they come into view on scroll. These will enhance the premium feel without being distracting.

## Visual Assets Strategy

*   **Icons:** Minimalist, line-based icons for sections like 'Secteurs et clients cibles' and 'Valeurs clés'.
*   **Backgrounds:** Clean, possibly subtle gradient or abstract pattern in the hero section, similar to Ento.ma but in the chosen neutral color palette.
*   **Images:** No prominent photographic images are planned, maintaining the minimalist approach. If any are used, they will be abstract or highly stylized to fit the high-end aesthetic.

## Typography Selection (Examples)

*   **Headings:** Montserrat, Lato, or Open Sans (bold weights for impact).
*   **Body Text:** Lato, Open Sans, or Roboto (regular weights for readability).

## Accent Color Consideration

*   A desaturated, modern accent color will be chosen during the asset collection phase, ensuring it complements the neutral palette and enhances the premium feel.
